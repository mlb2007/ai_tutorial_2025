    "#### Agentic orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this design pattern when we typically don't know the subtask to perform and we delegate the picking of the sub-tasks from a set of tasks to the orchestrator, who can spawn a series of workers (or a single worker) to do the job. In other words, this can do complicated stuff like orchestrating a mini work flow itself based on some criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this use case, we will write individual sections of a report with each section written by LLM. Note that writing each section in itself is a mini workflow and is not a simple parallel task but depends on what has been written before etc.\n"

       " 'completed_sections': [CompletedSection(name='Introduction to Qubits', content='# Introduction to Qubits: The Building Blocks of Quantum Computing\\n\\nQuantum computing is rapidly emerging as a revolutionary technology with the potential to solve complex problems far beyond the reach of classical computers. At the heart of this groundbreaking field lies the qubit, the fundamental unit of quantum information. Understanding qubits is essential to grasp how quantum computers operate and why they hold such promise for the future of computation.\\n\\n## What Are Qubits?\\n\\nA qubit, short for quantum bit, is the quantum analogue of the classical bit used in traditional computing. While a classical bit can exist in one of two states—0 or 1—a qubit can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This unique property arises from the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the phenomena of superposition and entanglement.\\n\\nIn more technical terms, a qubit is represented by a quantum state in a two-dimensional complex vector space. It can be described as:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n|\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha|0\\\\rangle + \\\\beta|1\\\\rangle\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\(|0\\\\rangle\\\\) and \\\\(|1\\\\rangle\\\\) are the basis states, and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are complex probability amplitudes that satisfy the normalization condition \\\\(|\\\\alpha|^2 + |\\\\beta|^2 = 1\\\\). This means that when measured, the qubit collapses to either 0 or 1 with probabilities \\\\(|\\\\alpha|^2\\\\) and \\\\(|\\\\beta|^2\\\\), respectively.\\n\\n## The Role of Qubits in Quantum Computing\\n\\nQubits are the cornerstone of quantum computing because they enable quantum computers to process and store information in ways that classical bits cannot. Here are some key roles qubits play in quantum computing:\\n\\n### 1. Superposition Enables Parallelism\\n\\nThanks to superposition, a quantum computer with multiple qubits can represent and process a vast number of possible states simultaneously. For example, two qubits can represent four states at once (00, 01, 10, 11), and three qubits can represent eight states, and so on exponentially. This parallelism allows quantum algorithms to explore many solutions at once, potentially solving certain problems much faster than classical algorithms.\\n\\n### 2. Entanglement Creates Strong Correlations\\n\\nEntanglement is a uniquely quantum phenomenon where the states of two or more qubits become interconnected such that the state of one qubit instantly influences the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This property is crucial for quantum error correction, quantum teleportation, and many quantum algorithms, enabling complex correlations that classical bits cannot replicate.\\n\\n### 3. Quantum Gates Manipulate Qubits\\n\\nQuantum gates are the operations that manipulate qubits, changing their states through unitary transformations. Unlike classical logic gates, quantum gates can create and manipulate superpositions and entanglement, allowing quantum circuits to perform complex computations. The ability to precisely control qubits through these gates is fundamental to executing quantum algorithms.\\n\\n## Physical Realizations of Qubits\\n\\nQubits can be physically realized using various quantum systems, each with its advantages and challenges.

Among these, trapped ion qubits stand out due to their exceptional coherence times and precise control. This article delves into the details of trapped ion qubits, explaining their underlying mechanism and highlighting their key advantages.\\n\\n## What Are Trapped Ion Qubits?\\n\\nTrapped ion qubits are quantum bits realized by confining individual ions—charged atoms—in electromagnetic traps and using their internal electronic states to represent quantum information. Each ion acts as a qubit, where two specific energy levels correspond to the logical states |0⟩ and |1⟩.\\n\\nThe ions are typically elements like calcium, ytterbium, or beryllium, chosen for their favorable atomic properties.

This is achieved using radiofrequency (RF) electric fields in a Paul trap or static magnetic and electric fields in a Penning trap. The trap confines ions in a small region of space, forming a linear chain or a two-dimensional array.\\n\\n### Qubit Encoding\\n\\nQuantum information is encoded in the ion’s internal states. Commonly, two hyperfine or electronic energy levels of the ion serve as the qubit states. These states are chosen for their long coherence times and ease of manipulation with lasers.\\n\\n### Initialization and Readout\\n\\nIons are initialized to a known quantum state using optical pumping techniques, which use laser light to prepare the ion in the |0⟩ state with high fidelity. Readout is performed by shining a laser that causes fluorescence only if the ion is in one of the qubit states, allowing measurement of the qubit state by detecting emitted photons.\\n\\n### Quantum Gates and Control\\n\\nQuantum logic gates are implemented by applying precisely tuned laser pulses to the ions. Single-qubit gates manipulate the internal states of individual ions, while multi-qubit gates exploit the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain to entangle qubits. The shared motion of the ions acts as a quantum bus, enabling interactions between distant qubits.\\n\\n## Advantages of Trapped Ion Qubits\\n\\n### Long Coherence Times\\n\\nTrapped ion qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times among qubit technologies, often lasting from seconds to minutes.

At the heart of this revolution lies the quantum bit, or qubit, the fundamental unit of quantum information. Among various qubit implementations, **topological qubits** have emerged as a promising candidate due to their inherent robustness against errors. This article delves into the concept of topological qubits, exploring their unique properties and why they hold great potential for building fault-tolerant quantum computers.\\n\\n## What Are Topological Qubits?\\n\\nTopological qubits are a type of qubit that leverage the principles of topology—a branch of mathematics concerned with properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformations. Unlike conventional qubits, which encode information in the quantum states of particles such as electrons or photons, topological qubits encode information in the global properties of a system’s quantum state. This encoding is tied to the system’s topology, making it inherently stable against local disturbances.\\n\\nThe key idea is that the quantum information is stored non-locally, spread out over a topological state of matter. This non-local storage means that small, local errors or noise are unlikely to corrupt the qubit’s state, providing a natural form of error protection.\\n\\n## How Do Topological Qubits Work?\\n\\nTopological qubits are typically realized using exotic quasiparticles called **anyons**, which can exist in two-dimensional materials under certain conditions. Anyons exhibit unique braiding statistics: when two anyons are exchanged, the quantum state of the system changes in a way that depends on the path taken during the exchange, not just the final positions. This property allows for the encoding and manipulation of quantum information through the braiding of anyons.\\n\\nOne of the most studied candidates for topological qubits involves **Majorana zero modes**, which are quasiparticles predicted to appear in certain superconducting materials. These Majorana modes can be paired and braided to perform quantum gates that are topologically protected.\\n\\n## The Potential for Error Resistance\\n\\nError correction is one of the biggest challenges in quantum computing. Qubits are extremely sensitive to their environment, and even tiny disturbances can cause decoherence, leading to errors in computation. Traditional qubit implementations require complex and resource-intensive error correction codes to maintain fidelity.\\n\\nTopological qubits offer a fundamentally different approach to error resistance:\\n\\n- **Intrinsic Protection:** Because the quantum information is stored in the global topological properties rather than local states, local noise and perturbations do not easily affect the qubit.\\n- **Reduced Error Rates:** The topological nature of the qubit means that certain types of errors are exponentially suppressed, potentially reducing the overhead needed for error correction.\\n- **Fault-Tolerant Operations:** Braiding operations used to manipulate topological qubits are inherently fault-tolerant, as they depend on the topology of the braiding path rather than precise control of local parameters.\\n\\n## Challenges and Current Research\\n\\nWhile topological qubits are theoretically promising, practical realization remains challenging. Creating and manipulating the necessary topological states requires advanced materials and precise experimental conditions, such as ultra-low temperatures and strong magnetic fields.\\n\\nCurrent research is focused on:\\n\\n- **Material Development:** Engineering materials that can host Majorana modes or other anyonic excitations.\\n- **Detection and Control:** Developing techniques to detect, braid, and measure anyons reliably.\\n- **Scalability:** Designing architectures that can scale topological qubits into large, functional quantum processors.\\n\\nSeveral experimental groups and companies are actively pursuing these goals, with recent progress bringing topological quantum computing closer to reality.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTopological qubits represent a groundbreaking approach to quantum computing, offering a path toward inherently error-resistant quantum information processing. By encoding information in the topological properties of quantum states, these qubits promise to overcome some of the most daunting challenges in building practical quantum computers. Although significant technical hurdles remain, ongoing research continues to unlock the potential of topological qubits, making them a key focus in the quest for robust, scalable quantum technologies.'),\n",

       " 'final_report': '# Introduction to Qubits: The Building Blocks of Quantum Computing\\n\\nQuantum computing is rapidly emerging as a revolutionary technology with the potential to solve complex problems far beyond the reach of classical computers. At the heart of this groundbreaking field lies the qubit, the fundamental unit of quantum information. Understanding qubits is essential to grasp how quantum computers operate and why they hold such promise for the future of computation.\\n\\n## What Are Qubits?\\n\\nA qubit, short for quantum bit, is the quantum analogue of the classical bit used in traditional computing. While a classical bit can exist in one of two states—0 or 1—a qubit can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This unique property arises from the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the phenomena of superposition and entanglement.\\n\\nIn more technical terms, a qubit is represented by a quantum state in a two-dimensional complex vector space. It can be described as:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n|\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha|0\\\\rangle + \\\\beta|1\\\\rangle\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\(|0\\\\rangle\\\\) and \\\\(|1\\\\rangle\\\\) are the basis states, and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are complex probability amplitudes that satisfy the normalization condition \\\\(|\\\\alpha|^2 + |\\\\beta|^2 = 1\\\\). This means that when measured, the qubit collapses to either 0 or 1 with probabilities \\\\(|\\\\alpha|^2\\\\) and \\\\(|\\\\beta|^2\\\\), respectively.\\n\\n## The Role of Qubits in Quantum Computing\\n\\nQubits are the cornerstone of quantum computing because they enable quantum computers to process and store information in ways that classical bits cannot. Here are some key roles qubits play in quantum computing:\\n\\n### 1. Superposition Enables Parallelism\\n\\nThanks to superposition, a quantum computer with multiple qubits can represent and process a vast number of possible states simultaneously. For example, two qubits can represent four states at once (00, 01, 10, 11), and three qubits can represent eight states, and so on exponentially. This parallelism allows quantum algorithms to explore many solutions at once, potentially solving certain problems much faster than classical algorithms.\\n\\n### 2. Entanglement Creates Strong Correlations\\n\\nEntanglement is a uniquely quantum phenomenon where the states of two or more qubits become interconnected such that the state of one qubit instantly influences the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This property is crucial for quantum error correction, quantum teleportation, and many quantum algorithms, enabling complex correlations that classical bits cannot replicate.\\n\\n### 3. Quantum Gates Manipulate Qubits\\n\\nQuantum gates are the operations that manipulate qubits, changing their states through unitary transformations.

Among these, trapped ion qubits stand out due to their exceptional coherence times and precise control. This article delves into the details of trapped ion qubits, explaining their underlying mechanism and highlighting their key advantages.\\n\\n## What Are Trapped Ion Qubits?\\n\\nTrapped ion qubits are quantum bits realized by confining individual ions—charged atoms—in electromagnetic traps and using their internal electronic states to represent quantum information. Each ion acts as a qubit, where two specific energy levels correspond to the logical states |0⟩ and |1⟩.\\n\\nThe ions are typically elements like calcium, ytterbium, or beryllium, chosen for their favorable atomic properties.

This is achieved using radiofrequency (RF) electric fields in a Paul trap or static magnetic and electric fields in a Penning trap. The trap confines ions in a small region of space, forming a linear chain or a two-dimensional array.\\n\\n### Qubit Encoding\\n\\nQuantum information is encoded in the ion’s internal states. Commonly, two hyperfine or electronic energy levels of the ion serve as the qubit states. These states are chosen for their long coherence times and ease of manipulation with lasers.\\n\\n### Initialization and Readout\\n\\nIons are initialized to a known quantum state using optical pumping techniques, which use laser light to prepare the ion in the |0⟩ state with high fidelity. Readout is performed by shining a laser that causes fluorescence only if the ion is in one of the qubit states, allowing measurement of the qubit state by detecting emitted photons.\\n\\n### Quantum Gates and Control\\n\\nQuantum logic gates are implemented by applying precisely tuned laser pulses to the ions. Single-qubit gates manipulate the internal states of individual ions, while multi-qubit gates exploit the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain to entangle qubits. The shared motion of the ions acts as a quantum bus, enabling interactions between distant qubits.\\n\\n## Advantages of Trapped Ion Qubits\\n\\n### Long Coherence Times\\n\\nTrapped ion qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times among qubit technologies, often lasting from seconds to minutes. This is due to the excellent isolation of ions in ultra-high vacuum and the use of atomic energy levels that are inherently stable.\\n\\n### High-Fidelity Operations\\n\\nLaser-based control allows for extremely precise quantum gate operations with fidelities exceeding 99.9%. This high accuracy is crucial for error correction and scalable quantum computing.\\n\\n### Scalability Potential\\n\\nWhile scaling trapped ion systems to thousands of qubits remains challenging, modular architectures using interconnected ion traps and photonic links are actively being developed. The ability to shuttle ions between trap zones also offers a pathway to larger quantum processors.\\n\\n### Universal Quantum Computing\\n\\nTrapped ion qubits support a universal set of quantum gates, enabling the implementation of any quantum algorithm.

At the heart of this revolution lies the quantum bit, or qubit, the fundamental unit of quantum information. Among various qubit implementations, **topological qubits** have emerged as a promising candidate due to their inherent robustness against errors. This article delves into the concept of topological qubits, exploring their unique properties and why they hold great potential for building fault-tolerant quantum computers.\\n\\n## What Are Topological Qubits?\\n\\nTopological qubits are a type of qubit that leverage the principles of topology—a branch of mathematics concerned with properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformations. Unlike conventional qubits, which encode information in the quantum states of particles such as electrons or photons, topological qubits encode information in the global properties of a system’s quantum state. This encoding is tied to the system’s topology, making it inherently stable against local disturbances.\\n\\nThe key idea is that the quantum information is stored non-locally, spread out over a topological state of matter. This non-local storage means that small, local errors or noise are unlikely to corrupt the qubit’s state, providing a natural form of error protection.\\n\\n## How Do Topological Qubits Work?\\n\\nTopological qubits are typically realized using exotic quasiparticles called **anyons**, which can exist in two-dimensional materials under certain conditions. Anyons exhibit unique braiding statistics: when two anyons are exchanged, the quantum state of the system changes in a way that depends on the path taken during the exchange, not just the final positions. This property allows for the encoding and manipulation of quantum information through the braiding of anyons.\\n\\nOne of the most studied candidates for topological qubits involves **Majorana zero modes**, which are quasiparticles predicted to appear in certain superconducting materials. These Majorana modes can be paired and braided to perform quantum gates that are topologically protected.\\n\\n## The Potential for Error Resistance\\n\\nError correction is one of the biggest challenges in quantum computing. Qubits are extremely sensitive to their environment, and even tiny disturbances can cause decoherence, leading to errors in computation. Traditional qubit implementations require complex and resource-intensive error correction codes to maintain fidelity.\\n\\nTopological qubits offer a fundamentally different approach to error resistance:\\n\\n- **Intrinsic Protection:** Because the quantum information is stored in the global topological properties rather than local states, local noise and perturbations do not easily affect the qubit.\\n- **Reduced Error Rates:** The topological nature of the qubit means that certain types of errors are exponentially suppressed, potentially reducing the overhead needed for error correction.\\n- **Fault-Tolerant Operations:** Braiding operations used to manipulate topological qubits are inherently fault-tolerant, as they depend on the topology of the braiding path rather than precise control of local parameters.\\n\\n## Challenges and Current Research\\n\\nWhile topological qubits are theoretically promising, practical realization remains challenging. Creating and manipulating the necessary topological states requires advanced materials and precise experimental conditions, such as ultra-low temperatures and strong magnetic fields.\\n\\nCurrent research is focused on:\\n\\n- **Material Development:** Engineering materials that can host Majorana modes or other anyonic excitations.\\n- **Detection and Control:** Developing techniques to detect, braid, and measure anyons reliably.\\n- **Scalability:** Designing architectures that can scale topological qubits into large, functional quantum processors.\\n\\nSeveral experimental groups and companies are actively pursuing these goals, with recent progress bringing topological quantum computing closer to reality.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTopological qubits represent a groundbreaking approach to quantum computing, offering a path toward inherently error-resistant quantum information processing. By encoding information in the topological properties of quantum states, these qubits promise to overcome some of the most daunting challenges in building practical quantum computers. Although significant technical hurdles remain, ongoing research continues to unlock the potential of topological qubits, making them a key focus in the quest for robust, scalable quantum technologies.\\n\\n# Photonic Qubits: Revolutionizing Quantum Communication\\n\\nQuantum computing and quantum communication represent the forefront of technological innovation, promising unprecedented capabilities in information processing and secure data transmission.

Photonic qubits are ideally suited for this purpose because photons can travel long distances through optical fibers or free space with minimal loss and decoherence.\\n\\n### Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)\\n\\nOne of the most prominent applications of photonic qubits is Quantum Key Distribution, a method for secure communication that allows two parties to generate a shared, secret key. Protocols like BB84 use the polarization states of photons to encode bits. The security of QKD arises from the fundamental quantum property that measurement disturbs the system, enabling detection of any eavesdropping.\\n\\n### Quantum Teleportation\\n\\nPhotonic qubits enable quantum teleportation, a process by which the quantum state of a photon is transmitted from one location to another without physically sending the photon itself. This is achieved through entanglement and classical communication, and it is a critical component for building quantum networks.\\n\\n### Quantum Repeaters and Networks\\n\\nLong-distance quantum communication faces challenges due to photon loss and decoherence. Photonic qubits are integral to the development of quantum repeaters, devices that extend the range of quantum communication by entangling photons over shorter segments and performing entanglement swapping. This technology is essential for realizing a global quantum internet.\\n\\n## Advantages of Photonic Qubits\\n\\n- **Low Decoherence:** Photons interact weakly with their environment, preserving quantum information over longer distances.\\n- **Room Temperature Operation:** Unlike many other qubit systems requiring ultra-cold temperatures, photonic systems can operate at or near room temperature.\\n- **Compatibility with Existing Infrastructure:** Photonic qubits can be transmitted through existing fiber-optic networks, facilitating integration with current communication systems.\\n\\n## Challenges and Future Outlook\\n\\nDespite their advantages, photonic qubits face challenges such as photon loss, imperfect detectors, and difficulties in generating on-demand single photons.
