Agents have agency, i.e. ability to make decisions/think.

The agentic workflow is needed when "thinking" has to be done. usually, this is
the human in the loop, but now, LLMs can be asked to understand meanings of
intention and make decision.

To support the actions, we add tools (function calls) that LLM can leverage and
execute. It results in an output, which the LLM observes and continues the loop
until some desired end point (set by user) is achieved.

So, the loop that LLM works thru is "Think, Act, Observe".

All of the above is achieved thru function calling, thus removing the human in
the loop for iterative work ...

Note: The LLM only decides if a tool must be used. It does not call the tool on
its own. It delegates it to the user, who must invoke the tool.
