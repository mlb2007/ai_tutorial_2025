LLMs: We make algorithm by examples, compared to making it by logic, a meta
language (like high level language)

Examples to LLM have to be given in proper syntactical form. Read the docs for

OLlama => Local run of LLM

gradio: <= UI with LLM

Use of pydantic to control output: See https://github.com/ShawhinT/AI-Builders-Bootcamp-5/tree/main/TA-extra-examples
